            <description><![CDATA[I love DataDog, and I love CloudFlare, and If you're aggressively caching as we do, a good portion of requests won't ever make it to the origin, which is a good thing.

            <description><![CDATA[My original blog was built with Ghost and hosted on DigitalOcean. And while I enjoyed my time with Ghost, there were a few things I wanted to explore outside its scope, like writing posts with MDX! Mounting React components in blog posts is really cool! While I did manage to work everything out, the migration was not a cakewalk, however. It's 2020, what could go wrong?]]></description>
