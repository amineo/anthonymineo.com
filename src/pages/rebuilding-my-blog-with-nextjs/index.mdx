My original blog was built with Ghost and hosted on DigitalOcean. And while I enjoyed my time with Ghost, there were a few things I wanted to explore outside its scope, **like writing posts with MDX!** Mounting React components in blog posts is really cool! While I did manage to work everything out, the migration was _not_ a cakewalk, however. It's 2020, what could go wrong?

### Motivation
Well... I'm addicted to learning things, can't help it, and saw this as an opportunity to further my experience with React and get more familiar with SSG.  

I choose Next.js over Gatsby not because I think its a better product, but because I felt that it was a better fit for my use case. I'm a fan of Gatsby and met some of their devs at last year's [JamStack Conf NYC - 2019](https://2019.jamstackconf.com/nyc/).
  
To me, Next.js's filesystem routing was key, and static site gen is one of its strongest points. I can simply create a `blog-post.mdx` file in the `./pages/` folder and that generates a route to `anthonymineo.com/blog-post`. Additionally, my `.mdx` files contain a `meta {}` object for the post's frontmatter that gets picked up automatically with the function `getStaticProps`. I felt that using a GraphQL API (Gatsby) for this was a bit overkill. So, I went with Next.js.

### The Migration Experience - (Figuring things out)
There were a few hurdles that I had to overcome migrating from Ghost. In Next.js, how do you generate a **sitemap? RSS? AMP? Post tags? Rewrites and redirects?** Not going to lie, it did seem a little daunting at first, but I was able to get through it at a decent pace.

First off, the [Next.js website/blog repo](https://github.com/vercel/next-site) and [Tailwind's blog](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/building-the-tailwind-blog) are treasure troves of information. Reading the official Next.js docs did feel a little lacking at times, and referring to their website's repo did help a ton. _Thanks guys!_

#### The Sitemap & RSS
Drawing inspiration from how Next.js' site and the Tailwind blog generate RSS, I wrote a script that generates a sitemap for my blog.

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import tinytime from 'tinytime';
const postDateTemplate = tinytime('{YYYY}-{Mo}-{DD}T{H}:{mm}:{ss}.0Z', { padMonth: true });

function importAll(r) {
    return r.keys().map((fileName) => ({
        link: fileName.substr(1).replace(/\/index\.mdx$/, ''),
        module: r(fileName)
    }));
}

function dateSortDesc(a, b) {
    if (a > b) return -1;
    if (a < b) return 1;
    return 0;
}

 function getAllPostPreviews() {
    return importAll(require.context('./pages/?preview', true, /\.mdx$/)).sort((a, b) =>
        dateSortDesc(a.module.meta.date, b.module.meta.date)
    );
}


let sitemapItems = '';

getAllPostPreviews().forEach(({ link, module: { meta } }) => {
    sitemapItems += `<url><loc>${`https://anthonymineo.com${link}/`}</loc><lastmod>${meta.updated}</lastmod></url>`;
});

const sitemap = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
                  <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
                    <url><loc>https://anthonymineo.com/</loc><lastmod>${postDateTemplate.render( new Date())}</lastmod></url>
                    ${sitemapItems}
                  </urlset>`;

fs.writeFileSync('./public/sitemap.xml', sitemap);

console.log(`âœ… sitemap.xml generated!`);

```
Running this script on build sticks an updated `sitemap.xml` file in `./public`.  Pretty sweet!

#### Tags
Tags were probably the most complicated part of the whole process and warrants a post of its own. For brevity, I was able to make it work using [Next.js's dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes). 

Essentially, I set up a page as: `pages/tag/[tag].js` where `[tag]` became a dynamic slug.  Using the incoming slug, I check it against a list of known, pre-defined tags, and if it exists in the list, return a list of matched posts; if not, return a 404.

Feel free to look at my blog's repo to see how I wired it up.

#### Rewrite & Redirects
I found two ways to handle this, and both are straight forward; Write them in your [next.config.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) or, if your hosting on Vercel, write them in [vercel.json](https://vercel.com/docs/configuration#project/rewrites).

Ultimately, I ended up writing them in the `vercel.json` file since I'm hosting my blog on Vercel.

#### AMP (*I felt really gross setting this up*)
The only reason I bothered setting up AMP was that Ghost handled it out of the box without any thought, and I didn't mind using it at the time until Google decided to brand the internet and your websites as "Google.com," but I digress. 

Next.js's AMP support is by page opt-in.  Enabling AMP for a blog post was as simple as adding `export const config = { amp: 'hybrid' }` to a `blog-post.mdx` file. 

However, if you're embedding your styles like me, you'll likely run into this issue outlined here: [https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/issues/238](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/issues/238#issuecomment-686830634), where styles won't generate on build for your amp pages, while your standard pages will look fine. Luckily, there's a workaround outlined in that post. :)

### Learning Experience
All in all, I'm pretty happy with it.  I got all the functionality from my old blog but with a significant benefit of making examples in my posts a bit more interactive.  Like my post on [Simple Child to Parent Communication](https://anthonymineo.com/simple-child-to-parent-communication-in-react/) in React. The example code now has like React component showing it in action!
