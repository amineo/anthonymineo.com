Hookdeck is a fantastic tool that helps you manage and tunnel external webhooks into a local development server, among other things. The Hookdeck-CLI is simple and works pretty well; however, I wanted its integration into our workflow to be more portable for fellow developers on our project. I was trying to avoid having everyone install yet-another-cli-tool.

The [Hookdeck-CLI](https://github.com/hookdeck/hookdeck-cli) is simple and works pretty well; however, I wanted its integration into our workflow to be more portable for fellow developers on our project. I was trying to avoid having everyone install yet-another-cli-tool.

## Using Docker Compose
Our project already uses docker-compose to wire up the various services in our app, so why not leverage what we already have? 

#### Take advantage of `docker-compose.override.yml` for local development.
 

Overriding the entrypoint command defined in the `hookdeck/hookdeck-cli` container, we can: 

 - Check if a stored auth config file exists in our volume or prompt user to login; 
 - Listen and tunnel to our target docker service.


```yml
#docker-compose.override.yml

version: "3.7"
services:

  # ...

  hookdeck:
    image: "hookdeck/hookdeck-cli:v0.4.4"
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh","-c"]
    command:
    - |
       /bin/hookdeck version
       [ -f /root/.config/hookdeck/config.toml ] && echo "Hookdeck config found!" || /bin/hookdeck login
       /bin/hookdeck listen http://target-docker-service-name:8080 your-hookdeck-source-name

    volumes:
      - hookdeck:/root/.config/hookdeck  # Store auth tokens in volume

    networks:
      - your-app-network # This is important! This service needs to be on the same network as your app or they wont be able to communicate


volumes:
  hookdeck:


networks:
  your-app-network:
    driver: bridge

```

Now, if you run `docker-compose up hookdeck`. The hookdeck-cli container will start and **output a link to login from the terminal.** Once you login, the creds are stored in a persistent volume and are always available on `docker-compose up`.



And that's it! Simple and portable. :)
