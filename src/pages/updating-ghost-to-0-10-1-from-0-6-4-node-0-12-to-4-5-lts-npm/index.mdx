The development of Ghost has been moving pretty fast. My version of Ghost was way out of date and the version of Node I was running wasn't even LTS. My blog was pretty much just left in the dust...

<!--/excerpt-->



The development of [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases) has been moving pretty fast. My version of Ghost was way out of date and the version of Node I was running wasn't even LTS. *My blog was pretty much just left in the dust...* 

This year has been full of life changing events and I haven't been able to find the time to sit down and give this blog as much love as I'd like. **Anyways, now is the time to make time**. So, my first order of business was to get this baby up to date!

Before I attempted to do anything, I read through Ghost's [release logs](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases) for any major changes to it's prerequisites or dependencies. As of Ghost <small>v</small>0.9.0, they recommend Node <small>v</small>4 for running Ghost... I was running 0.12.

## Updating Ghost
The good folks at Ghost put together a nice [upgrade guide](http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/) that documents the procedure pretty thoroughly. It might also be good idea to bookmark that link as they do keep it fairly up-to-date with each release.


```bash
## My TL;DR modified from their guide

## Example path for Ghost's install
# /var/www/ghost

cd /var/www/

## Download the latest version of Ghost:
curl -LOk https://ghost.org/zip/ghost-latest.zip

## Unzip to a temp directory (/var/www/ghost-temp):
unzip ghost-latest.zip -d ghost-temp

## Change directory into your current ghost install:
cd ghost  # /var/www/ghost

## Remove the core directoy:
rm -rf core

## Change back to your ghost download (ghost-temp)
cd /var/www/ghost-temp/

## Copy the new core directory to your Ghost install:
cp -R core /var/www/ghost

## Copy the other key files to your Ghost install directory:
cp index.js *.json /var/www/ghost

## (optional) Update Casper by copying the casper folder:
cp -R content/themes/casper /var/www/ghost/content/themes

## Change back to your ghost install directory:
cd /var/www/ghost

## (optional) Update permissions:
chown -R ghost:ghost *


## Do not update dependencies yet!
## It will fail because Node & NPM have not yet been updated

```



##Update Node from 0.12 to 4.5 LTS
Updating Node wasn't difficult. NPM has a neat package called "**[n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n)**" which allows you to interactively manage your Node versions with a few terminal commands.

```bash
## Clear npm's cache
sudo npm cache clean -f

## Install n globally
sudo npm install -g n

## Let n know what version of Node you want running.
## In our case, we want LTS (4.5.0)
n lts

## Be sure to checkout n's docs for more info on usage:
## https://www.npmjs.com/package/n

## Verify that our Node version is correct
node -v
## v4.5.0
```



## Finally, Update NPM & Ghost's Dependencies
Initially, after updating Node, I tried running `npm install --production` and got a strange error.
```bash
npm WARN cannot run in wd ghost@0.10.1 node core/server/utils/npm/preinstall.js (wd=/var/www/ghost)
```
Updating NPM did the trick!
```bash
## Update NPM with... NPM!
npm install npm -g

## Update Ghost's deps
npm install --production
```



### Overcoming My Last Set of Issues
#### NPM KILL
While `npm install` did start to run, it would eventually stop before it fully completed and scream <Highlight>NPM KILL!</Highlight> at me...

So... why the heck is it timing out and killing the install task?
*Well,* before I started I created a "Cloned Droplet" in DigitalOcean with a potato instance (512GB/1CPU) for my staging server to test off of. As it turns out, this was my issue. NPM install was overloading my micro instance. After I increased its resources to 2GB/2CPU it went off without a hitch. 

#### 502 Bad Gateway after Ghost restart
Trying to start ghost with `npm start --production` resulted in a 502 error. Somewhere my permissions got crossed but I was able to fix it by running:
```bash
chown -R ghost:ghost ghost/*
```


*All systems go!*
