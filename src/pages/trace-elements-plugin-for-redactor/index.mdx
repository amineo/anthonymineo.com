Uncover any unnecessary tags generated by the editor. This plugin adds the ability to toggle a trace on common parent block-level elements with an outline and their element name. The purpose for creating this plugin was so that it becomes a little clearer on what my WYSIWYG is doing.

This plugin adds the ability to toggle a trace on common parent block-level elements with an outline and their element name.

The purpose for creating this plugin was so that it becomes a little clearer on what my WYSIWYG is doing. Is it adding unnecessary `<p>` tags? Are there empty `<div>`,`<ul>` or `<h*>` elements? Without jumping into source view it's hard to tell.

It also comes in handy for writers/editors who may not be as familiar with HTML or the source view.


**Currently the plugin traces these common block elements by default:**  
  - div
  - br
  - p
  - ul
  - ol
  - pre
  - h1
  - h2
  - h3
  - h4
  - h5
  - h6

## How to Extend
You can easily extend what gets traced with CSS! Just modify the selector below and add to your stylesheet.

```css
/* Replace ELEMENTNAME with the element you want to trace */
.redactor-trace.redactor-layer > ELEMENTNAME:after {
   content:'ELEMENTNAME';
}
```
This plugin makes use of `::after` with the `content` property so it's fast and customizable.

## How to Initialize

            plugins: ['TraceElements']
        });
