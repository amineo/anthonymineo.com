During my adventures in learning React, I came across a particular roadblock with independent component communication. I understand how 'parent-child components' talk. The React doc's explain that pretty well. However, a place that could use an improvement is explaining with examples on how to make independent components communicate.

<!--/excerpt-->



During my adventures in learning React, I came across a particular roadblock with independent component communication. I understand how **[parent-child components](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/communicate-between-components.html)** talk. The React doc's explain that pretty well. However, a place that could use an improvement is explaining (*with examples*) on how to make independent components communicate.

As React's official documentation specifies:
>For communication between two components that don't have a parent-child relationship, you can set up your own global event system. Subscribe to events in **componentDidMount()**, unsubscribe in **componentWillUnmount()**, and call **setState()** when you receive an event. [Flux pattern](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) is one of the possible ways to arrange this.

Basically this just says... You need to use an event system and they recommend the Flux Pattern.

Flux is intriguing and definitely worth looking into, but I also felt it might of been a little overkill for what I was trying to accomplish. So instead, I opted to use the [PubSubJS](https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS) library and it was magic. PubSubJS is a very handy [topic-based publish/subscribe system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) that could be integrated into your application without too much work.

## Example Scenario

#### The hypothetical File Manager UI with 2 separate components

**Component A** will be the *file-upload* component and **Component B** is the available files in our file manager component that will be rendered from an AJAX request.

Our goal is for the file-upload component (*the publisher*) to trigger an event after the upload has completed successfully and in-turn letting the file-list component (*the subscriber*) know it should fire a request to get the updated list of files.


## Example Code
#### Setup

 * **Install** <Highlight>[PubSubJS](https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS)</Highlight>  (by Morgan Roderick)<br/>`$ npm install pubsub-js --save-dev`

 * **Install** <Highlight>[React-Dropzone-Component
](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/React-Dropzone-Component)</Highlight> (by Felix Rieseberg)<br/>
`$ npm install react-dropzone-component --save-dev`<br/>
*This component is a wrapper for the [Dropzone.js](http://www.dropzonejs.com) library*.

 * **Install** <Highlight>[then-request](https://github.com/then/then-request)</Highlight> (by Forbes Lindesay & Nathan Zadoks) a nice and simple library for making requests with promises.<br/>
`$ npm install then-request --save-dev`
   
*Note: You do not have to use then-request for AJAX calls. I chose it for this example because it's lightweight and the syntax is very clean.*
