I love DataDog, and I love CloudFlare, and If you're aggressively caching as we do, a good portion of requests won't ever make it to the origin, which is a good thing. However, a downside is that you'll likely miss out on having complete traffic logs. **Fortunately, using CloudFlare Workers can help us solve this issue**.

### Generate an API Key in DataDog

First, we need to create a **new** API key for CloudFlare Workers to use. Please don't use an already existing one! ;)

### Setup a KV Store in CloudFlare

Now, in CloudFlare, go ahead and create a new KV Namespace for `datadog`. Then, we need to create a key-value pair for our API Key.

In our example, let's use `apikey` for the key name and **your DataDog API key** for the value.

  height="283"
/>

In our code, we can call `datadog.get("apikey")` and get back our key's value. How convenient!

### Let's get coding!

So, the whole idea here is to take the browsers request and response for a resource and then forward it out to DataDog for logging via a CloudFlare worker.

Since we have complete control over what's being sent to DataDog in the `data` object, you can sanitize or enhance whatever you like before it gets sent off.

**CloudFlare Worker**

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  // Prevent errors on the frontend if DataDog's API acts up
  event.passThroughOnException()
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event))
})

async function handleRequest(event) {
  const response = await fetch(event.request)

  event.waitUntil(logToDataDog(event.request, response))
  return response
}

async function logToDataDog(request, response) {
  // Get our key from CloudFlare KV store
  const dd_apikey = await datadog.get('apikey')
  let dd_logsEndpoint = 'https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com/v1/input/' + dd_apikey

  let hostname = request.headers.get('host') || ''

  // data to log
  let data = {
    ddsource: 'cloudflare',
    ddtags: 'service:cloudflare,source:cloudflare,site:' + hostname,
    hostname: hostname,
    message: {
      date_access: Date.now(),
      http: {
        protocol: request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto') || '',
        host: request.headers.get('host') || '',
        status_code: response.status,
        method: request.method,
        url_details: request.url,
        referer: request.headers.get('referer') || '',
      },
      useragent_details: {
        ua: request.headers.get('user-agent') || '',
      },
      network: {
        cc: request.headers.get('Cf-Ipcountry') || '',
      },
      cloudflare: {
        ray: request.headers.get('cf-ray') || '',
        visitor: request.headers.get('cf-visitor') || '',
      },
    },
  }

  await fetch(dd_logsEndpoint, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
    headers: new Headers({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }),
  })
}
```

**How it all looks in DataDog**

And there we have it! CloudFlare logs in DataDog. :)
