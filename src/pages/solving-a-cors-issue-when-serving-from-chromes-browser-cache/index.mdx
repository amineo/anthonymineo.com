## The Setup
I wrote a static script file hosted in an S3 bucket and then served via CloudFront on a different subdomain. That script also dynamically loaded another script.

So the call stack looked something like this:
 - website.com/page.html
   - static.website.com/script1.js
     - static.website.com/script2.js

### The S3 Bucket permissions had CORS configured like this:
```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "*"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "HEAD"
    ],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": [],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

Nothing crazy. We're just allowing the GET and HEAD methods, letting any origin access it, and setting a max-age.

### The CloudFront distribution also had the correct headers whitelisted:
 - Access-Control-Request-Headers
 - Access-Control-Request-Method
 - Origin


## The Problem

It appeared that everything was working fine in FireFox, Safari, and Chrome. However, in Chrome, when the browser served the script file from its cache, I was getting the classic CORS error:

>	"No `access-control-allow-origin` header is present on the 	requested resource."

As it turns out, the cached version does not contain the CORS headers in Chrome. It drops the request as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin violation` since the location is from the (disk cache) instead of `static.website.com`.



## The Solution
There are few ways to solve this.

By far, the quickest way is adding the attribute `crossorigin="anonymous"` to the script tagâ€”the [crossorigin attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin), among other things, hints to the browser that it shouldn't cache the CORS headers.

A possibly more involved approach, depending on your setup, is to have the server respond with a `Vary: Origin` header. If you're using something like Nginx, this is pretty simple as you can add a response header. Adding a response header to CloudFront is a bit tedious as you need to use Lambda@Edge, which to me felt like overkill.

In the end, I formatted my script tag like `<script src="https://static.website.com/script1.js" crossorigin="anonymous">` and Chrome's CORS issue when serving from cache went away.
