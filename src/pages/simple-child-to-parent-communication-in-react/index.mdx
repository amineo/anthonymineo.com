In React, passing data from a parent to its child is pretty simple, it can easily  trickle down through props. But what about the other way around... without using **Flux** or **PubSub**?

In React, passing data from a parent to its child is pretty simple, it can easily  trickle down through props. But what about the other way around... without using **Flux** or **PubSub**?

Well, sending data from a child to its parent is simple too. <Highlight>You can actually bubble up your function through props.</Highlight> It just requires a little bit of work to get started.


<Parent />

<LineBreakA />

```javascript
// Our Parent Class
class Parent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = {
            data: "Default parent state"
        };
        
        /*
         Bind our childHandler function to this context
         that will get called from our Child component
        */
        this.childHandler = this.childHandler.bind(this)
    }

    /*
     Function that gets called when
     we bubble up our `return` from Child 
    */
    childHandler(dataFromChild) {
        // log our state before and after we updated it
        console.log('%cPrevious Parent State: ' + JSON.stringify(this.state), "color:orange");
        this.setState({
            data: dataFromChild
        },() => console.log('Updated Parent State:', this.state));
    }

    render() {
        /*
         Set our childHandler function as a value to a prop that
         gets passed down to our Child component
        */
        return <Child action={this.childHandler} />
    }
}



// Child Class
class Child extends React.Component {
    /*
      Our onClick event will return the function that gets set to our action prop
      that then gets passed into the Parent's childHandler function.
    */
    render() {
        return <a onClick={() => this.props.action('Set Parent state set from child: ' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 999))}>Update Parent</a>;
    }
}




// Render
ReactDOM.render(
    <Parent />,
    document.getElementById('container')
);
```
