Your container is running... but is it working? You should have health checks defined for all your containers. The **HEALTHCHECK** instruction tells Docker how to test a container to make sure it's working properly.

Your container is running... but is it working? You should have health checks defined for all your containers. 

The [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) instruction tells Docker how to test a container to make sure it's working properly. As your infrastructure becomes increasingly complex, health checks become even more important.


## Writing the HEALTHCHECK
Creating a health check is really easy and since we're already using Node for our application why not use it to write our health check as well?


### healthcheck.js
```js
const http = require('http');
const options = {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 80,
    timeout: 2000
};

const healthCheck = http.request(options, (res) => {
    console.log(`HEALTHCHECK STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);
    if (res.statusCode == 200) {
        process.exit(0);
    }
    else {
        process.exit(1);
    }
});

healthCheck.on('error', function (err) {
    console.error('ERROR');
    process.exit(1);
});

healthCheck.end();
```

Looking at the code, you can see it's pretty straightforward. Obviously, you'll need to customize the `host` and `port` to fit your needs. The `healthCheck` function simply makes a request to the host and if the host does not return a status code of `200` something is broken.

### Dockerfile
```docker
HEALTHCHECK --interval=10s --timeout=2s --start-period=15s \  
    CMD node /healthcheck.js
```

Finally, enable the health check by adding the HEALTHCHECK instruction to your `Dockerfile`. Notice the command that runs `healthcheck.js`. Update that path accordingly and you should be set!
