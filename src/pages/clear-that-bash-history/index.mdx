<!--excerpt-->

Bash stores a history of commands that were previously executed by a user in plain text (`.bash_history`). As you probably realize, this becomes a security issue when you're running commands that contain sensitive information

<!--/excerpt-->

Bash stores a history of commands that were executed by a user in a plain text file (`.bash_history`). *Well, actually it stores those previously ran commands in memory first, then writes it out to `.bash_history`*. This allows you to easily scroll through and run a previously entered command.

However, as you probably realize, this also becomes a security issue when you're running commands that contain sensitive information... like `echo "MyPassword" | docker secret create db_pass -`, which you wouldn't ever want to be logged in plain text. Because of this, it's important to keep that history clear and because I'm forgetful (*just ask my wife*) it becomes important to just have it clear automatically. 

### Crontab: Clearing bash history
Using the Crontab editor we can easily setup a job to clear it for us at whatever cron schedule we specify. For my example we're going to clear it at 11pm everynight. 
```bash
crontab -e
```

**Once the contab editor opens:**
```
# Clear bash history everynight at 11pm
00 23 * * * cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history
```

_Pro Tip:_ If you're new to cron syntax, https://crontab.guru/ is an excellent resource for cron schedule expressions.


### The Manual Method

To clear bash history on demand you can run:
```bash
cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c
```
This clears the `.bash_history` log and the log that gets stored in memory *before* it writes to `.bash_history`

`cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history` clears the bash history text file and `history -c` clears the history stored in memory.


### Bonus (user-data.sh)
You can leverage `user-data.sh` and have this contab configured and running automatically when you spinup a new server! How awesome is that!
```bash
crontab -l -u root | echo "00 23 * * * cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history" | crontab -u root -
```
