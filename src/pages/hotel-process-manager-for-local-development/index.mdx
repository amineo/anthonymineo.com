[Hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel) is a simple process manager for developers that allows you to start your apps from a browser and even access them using <Highlight>.localhost</Highlight> domains. It practically works with all servers and even supports **https**, *although you'll still have to manually trust the cert on your machine*.

I stumbled upon [Hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel) when I was reading through some of the newer AdonisJS docs. I was a bit surprised I hadn't heard about it earlier. It's really handy! You don't have to remember any app start commands or ports. It's all stored for you :)

**Getting started with Hotel is really simple.**

```bash
# Install and start Hotel
npm install -g hotel && hotel start


# Add your server to Hotel
~/projects/node-app 
$ hotel add 'npm start'


# Or you can start a server with a temporary .localhost domain
~/projects/jekyll-app 
$ hotel add 'jekyll serve --port $PORT'
```

Hotel has a dashboard that allows you to start/stop and view the logs of all your local servers. By default, it's located at http://localhost:2000 or http://hotel.localhost.

## Getting .localhost to work
This requires a extra step, but no worries it's pretty easy.

**On macOS:**
`Network Preferences > Advanced > Proxies > Automatic Proxy Configuration`

**For Windows/Linux or via browser config:**
You can find instructions on the official docs - https://github.com/typicode/hotel/blob/master/docs/README.md


## It works with CommandBox!
For my ColdFusion friends, you can add your [CommandBox](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/content/embedded_server/server_port_and_host.html) server with the snippet below. You can pass any arguments you like into that command string.

```bash
~/projects/your-lucee-commandbox-app 
$ hotel add 'box server start port=$PORT' --port 8080
```
Then simply visit http://your-lucee-commandbox-app.localhost in the browser and Hotel will automatically tell CommandBox to start that particular server for you. *How awesome!*

**Note:** Depending on your machine and how fast the server spins up, Hotel might prematurely toss an error at you saying "the server was unreachable". **This is because the embedded CFML server has not finished starting up**. Just refresh the page in a few seconds and you should be good. 


## Some additional commands
```
hotel ls             # List servers
hotel rm <app-name>  # Remove server
hotel start          # Start hotel daemon
hotel stop           # Stop hotel daemon
```
